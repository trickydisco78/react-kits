It's a challenging but highly rewarding career and the course will give you the knowledge, skills and abilities to help improve the health and welfare of children by delivering safe, effective and compassionate care.</p><p><strong>Why study our course?</strong></p><p>BSc(Hons) Nursing (Children's) is accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and leads to registration as a children's nurse with the NMC. As well as learning the theory of child nursing practice and studying the subjects that underpin it, you will develop strong inter-professional and interpersonal skills, together with the ability to make a positive impact on the health and care needs of children. With fully integrated work-based training and outstanding onsite facilities, you will be taught by a close-knit, supportive team with a depth of clinical and research experience.</p><p><strong>Real-world experience</strong></p><p>The course has a strong practical focus, incorporating case-based learning with extensive use of our purpose-built children's nursing simulation suite. Half your time will be spent on placements in NHS hospitals and with specialist independent and voluntary sector employers in a mix of urban, suburban and rural environments. Throughout your course, you will engage with service users, practising nurses and other healthcare professionals - in placements, in class and in online learning. There are also options to develop and apply your skills working abroad.</p><p><strong>Where it can take you</strong></p><p>There are many exciting career opportunities in a wide variety of roles. You could work within hospitals or in areas such as school nursing, health visiting and children's community nursing - for the NHS, private or voluntary sector employers.

This must be clearly demonstrated in the 'personal statement' section of the application form, by saying why you want to study Children's Nursing and any relevant work experience that you have gained to date.</p><p>We encourage applications from all those interested in nursing or midwifery. Nursing and Midwifery are both physically and emotionally demanding professions and UWE positively implements the principles of the Equality Act 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students on nursing or midwifery programmes are expected to engage in the full range of clinical duties whilst on placement, which constitutes half of the nursing or midwifery programmes. As a student on a professional nursing or midwifery programme you must be mindful of the requirement in the NMC code of Practice 2015, which states that registered nurses must maintain the level of health needed to carry out our professional role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Offers of places are subject to occupational health clearance and students are expected to disclose pre-existing and historical health conditions. Students on professional programmes have to meet specific requirements related to the need to demonstrate certain knowledge, skills and competencies required by professional, statutory orregulatory bodies that cannot be compromised. In considering Reasonable Adjustments, these will be taken into account when agreeing what adjustments are possible.</p>",

The amount of on-line and distance learning increases over the three year course.  </p>\r\n<p>We expect you to take a great deal of the responsibility for your own learning as many of the modules will be taught using a blended learning approach. Blended learning is learning that is made possible by the effective combination of different ways of delivery information. This approach allows students to develop their knowledge and understanding by using blended resources which combine e-learning and e-tutoring. </p>\r\n<p>E-learning is the information technology transfer of skills and knowledge. E-learning applications and processes include web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual classroom opportunities and digital collaboration. Aspects of the programme will be delivered using e-learning and supported by e-tutoring. Students will acquire skills in self-directed and independent study, research and the key skills required for any workplace activity. The course will provide an excellent preparation for future professional development, enabling students to transfer skills across a range of professional roles.</p>\r\n<p>Teaching and learning methods range from lectures, seminars, skills development, simulation, on-line activities, service user and carer led sessions and student-led presentations. Person centred studies focusing on individual people is a core learning activity. Support for studying is provided by academic staff and during practice placements by qualified nursing staff.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Study themes running through the course include:</li>\r\n\t<li>Nursing theory and practice</li>\r\n\t<li>Nursing management</li>\r\n\t<li>Interpersonal skills</li>\r\n\t<li>Development of professional practice</li>\r\n\t<li>Bio-psychosocial development of the individual across the lifespan</li>\r\n\t<li>Health, wellness and illness</li>\r\n\t<li>Health care systems</li>\r\n\t<li>Interprofessional working</li>\r\n\t<li>Skills development</li>\r\n\t<li>Research skills</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A number of these themes will be developed and taught alongside other health and social care student groups.</p>\r\n<p>For more details see our full <a href=\"http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/students/academicadvice/learningandteachingterms.aspx\">glossary of learning and teaching terms</a>.</p>",

Practice hours need to be 'signed off' by a suitably qualified mentor.

Students must demonstrate that there is a clinical need for which prescribing from the community practitioner formulary will improve patient/client care and service delivery.
